Description: The WHAMP branch of EpiModelHIV provides extensions to our general EpiModel package to allow for simulating HIV transmission
  dynamics among males who have sex with males (MSM) in Washington State. It expands the base package from two to three racial/ethnic groups
  and incorporates heterogeneity on region and age.
